# Coercion

Support for coercing basic data types.

Provides:

- coercion protocols which define `asInt`, `asString` and so on
- implementations of these protocols for foundation data types
- a `Converter` protocol which can take an `Any` object and turn it into a known type using the coercion protocols
- subscript operators for Dictionary which look up a key by type: `asInt:`, `asString:` etc, performing coercion where possible
